# Breast-Cancer-Prediction-using-Wisconsin-data-

# Objective

To develop a predictive model that uses patient diagnostic data and predicts if the patient is suffering from malignant or benign. This model will help the healthcare professionals to identify the stage of cancer.

// This model is build with the help of Logistic Regression, decision tree, lightgbm and svm(Support Vector Machine).
 
# Dataset

The datset is downloaded from UCI machine learning repository. The Features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image.
